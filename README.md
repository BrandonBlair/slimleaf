# slimleaf
Slim, readable, expressive approach to browser automation.

## Page.py
Controls the browser in an obvious, readable way. Easily extensible and ripe for customization, the Page class takes a selenium driver object and gets to work.

## WebElement.py
This is where the magic happens. Wraps common automation functionality into a robust, readable class that enables developers (new and experienced) to write fast, expressive tests. By extending functionality discerningly, one can build a framework that encourages good practices while making bad practices harder to employ and easier to identify.
